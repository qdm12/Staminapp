# Staminapp: Mobile app for smarter coffee consumption

##### What is it?
This is an Android application able to communicate with the back-end server of Stamina.
It tracks the user's real life activities with the smartwatch and the GPS and communicates with the server.
It displays informative and interactive notifications to the user on his smartphone and smartwatch, such as:
-	You should stop drinking coffee today, your sleep is in danger!
-	You're in a coffee zone, you could grab a cup of coffee!
-	You just drunk your last cup of coffee today
-	You should drink a coffee before you do your physical activity.
-	Are you performing a physical activity now? YES or NO
-	Are you drinking a coffee now? YES or NO

All these answers are generally obtained from a complex back-end using machine learning techniques.

##### Compatibility
- Only compatible with Android 5.0 for full support of new features of Android Wear.
- Compatible with any Android smartwatch which has a gyroscope sensor and a linear acceleration sensor.
- The mobile app is tailored to work with Stamina back-end but could easily be modified.

##### Development
This Android application was developed using Android Studio 2.0 and Java 7.
It was always debugged on a Nexus 5X with a Motorola Moto 360 smartwatch.
Don't forget to update the Android SDK with the latest updates.
